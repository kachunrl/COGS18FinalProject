    "My project is called AlumniBot. The UCSD Career Center recently started a new program called the \"Take a Triton to Work,\" its purpose is to provide students the opportunity to build a connection with a UCSD alumnus who is located near their home town. The connection is a good way for students to learn more about the alumnus' academic background and professional occupation. This way, students get to explore career pathways of their interest through a one-on-one connection, which can potentially grow to become a mentorship. Take a Triton to Work was launched in Spring 2019 and is about to go through its second quarter this Fall 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program itself has received many positive feedbacks from both the students and alumni, and for this reason, the program will receive the necessary funding and support to continue in the future. However, one main issue of the first two quarters of Take a Triton to Work is that \"Match Day\" has been very labor exhaustive. Students are required to attend one of the Match Day sessions, where they would arrive, all go into a room together, then be called up one at a time: a staff member awaits at a computer with a spreadsheet of alumni, the students would indicate which alumnus they want, and the staff would check off one of their availability boxes (each alumnus will have 3-5 availability boxes). Each student is advised to have a list of top 10 alumni, if the first alumnus they wanted ran out of availability boxes, the staff member will have check if their second choice is available. The time it takes for the staff to go down a student's list until there's an availability box for one of their choices (could be 3rd or 9th choice, if at all) not only equates to repetitive scrolling and skimming that's mentally draining, it also prolongs the process of matching students with the alumni of their choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before Match Day, students are given a form of up to hundreds of participating alumni along with things such as their location, professional field, and availabilities. Aside from having to flip through pages and pages of alumni files, students can unknowingly choose alumni who are no longer available since it's difficult for availability boxes to be updated live on Match Day as they are checked off. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an intern at the career center, I thought it will be a good idea if I can find a way to make Match Day less labor-intensive and improve the flow of Take a Triton to Work. For the scope of this project, I hope it can allow students to sort through the list of alumni by info categories (Region, Area, City, Industry) so it will be easier for them to pick out their top choices. In the future, I hope to build the AlumniBot so it will also display alumni's availability boxes as they are updated. That way, students won't choose unavailable alumni and the matching process can be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented guidelines so users can use the AlumniInfoBot with as little amount of inconvenience as possible. I used some functions from the A3 ChatBot assignment, but all the other functions are original and self-written. "
